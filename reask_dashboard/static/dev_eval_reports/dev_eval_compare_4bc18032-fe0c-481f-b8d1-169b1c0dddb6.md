## Query
```
What is iLab?
```

## Parameters
- **Temperature:** N/A
- **Top P:** N/A
- **Max Tokens:** N/A

## Custom Prompt
```
Batch 1: 
Batch 2: 
```

## LLM Output
```
BATCH 1 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a comprehensive operations software designed to assist users in managing and navigating various functionalities within research facilities. It provides tools for signing up, logging in, managing lab memberships, adding payment information, and accessing core facilities. The platform caters to different user roles such as Core Customers, Lab Group Managers, and Core Administrators by offering tailored resources and guides [1]. Additionally, iLab includes features like video tutorials for visual learners and a resource library with detailed user manuals and quick reference sheets [2].

BATCH 2 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a software platform designed to assist users in managing and navigating various laboratory operations. It provides tools for signing up, logging in, managing lab memberships, adding payment information, and accessing core facilities. The platform supports different user roles such as core customers, lab group managers, and core administrators by offering detailed guides and resources tailored to their needs [1][2]. Additionally, iLab includes features like video tutorials for visual learners and a comprehensive resource library with user manuals and quick reference sheets [2].

## Developer Evaluation
[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt:**
  - Clearly define the context and user query in the prompt.
  - Include specific instructions or examples to guide the model's response.
  - Example:
    ```
    Query: What is iLab?
    Context: Provide a detailed explanation of iLab, including its functionalities, user roles it supports, and available resources. Use inline citations where applicable.
    ```

- **Adjusting Parameters for Optimal Results:**
  - Set `temperature` to around 0.7 to balance creativity and coherence.
  - Set `top_p` to around 0.9 for diverse but relevant outputs.
  - Define `max_tokens` based on desired response length, e.g., `max_tokens=150`.

- **Identifying Issues or Gaps in the Source Data:**
  - Ensure all sources are up-to-date and comprehensive.
  - Verify that all necessary information about iLab's features and user roles is included.

- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps:**
  - Test different parameter settings (e.g., varying temperature from 0.5 to 1) to find the optimal balance for your specific use case.
  - Experiment with different prompt structures and additional context details to improve specificity and relevance of responses.
  - Regularly update source data to reflect any changes or new features in iLab.

By following these suggestions, developers can enhance clarity, specificity, and effectiveness of prompts while optimizing parameters for better results.
## LLM Analysis

[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:**

   Both batches used the same parameters (System Prompt: Default prompt, Temperature: 0.3, Top P: 1, Max Tokens: 1000) and had only one run each. Given that all parameters are identical, any differences in the responses can be attributed to inherent variability in the model's generation process rather than parameter changes.

2. **Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:**

   Since both batches used identical settings, there is no clear distinction between which set of parameters worked better based on this comparison alone. Both responses provided a comprehensive overview of iLab with slight variations in wording and detail.

3. **Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:**

   - **Temperature:** Keeping it at 0.3 is suitable as it ensures coherent and focused responses without too much randomness.
   - **Top P:** Setting it to 1 ensures that all words are considered during generation, which is appropriate for detailed and factual queries like this.
   - **Max Tokens:** A limit of 1000 tokens is sufficient to provide detailed answers without cutting off important information.
   
   For similar factual queries about software or platforms:
   - Maintain a low temperature (around 0.2-0.4) to ensure accuracy and coherence.
   - Keep Top P at 1 to allow comprehensive coverage of the topic.
   - Adjust Max Tokens based on expected response length; typically, 500-1000 tokens should suffice.

In conclusion, both sets of parameters were effective for generating accurate and detailed descriptions of iLab. The slight variations in output highlight natural variability rather than parameter influence given their identical settings.
